# Automatic build and deploy

## Gitlab

Create a branch for yourself by clicking on `plus` button as following:

Name your branch according to the format `oran-student-???`, make sure `???` is the same as your username to access devvm as well as your namespace created in Kubernetese. For example, my K8s namespace is `tuan`, and my username to devvm is also `tuan`, then my branch name is `oran-student-tuan`.

Now at the left sidebar, go to `Build` -> `Pipelines` and click on `New pipeline`.

Select your own branch and run `New pipeline`.

After that, you should see this screen. When a job is running, you can click on it to see the detail.

The detail of a job is like this:

You need to wait until the job is done. If a job is succesful, you will see its message at the end of the terminal area, for example:

- A succesful build job
